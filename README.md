# Fluid-Solutions-ML

### **Overview**

This is a repo dedicated to the development and training of an Long Short-Term Memory ML model. The main use of this model will be to accurate predict a patient's blood volume status in real-time based on basic patient metrics and vitals. This will be accomplsihed by fine-tuning a basic PyTorch LSTM.
